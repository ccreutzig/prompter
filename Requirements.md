# Requirements

## User
A puppetteer, we'll call him Rob. Rob is usually alone on the stage and literally has his hands full moving the puppets around. All live controls have to be accessible via foot switches.

## Controls

These controls should include:
* Displaying the script of the play on a tablet. Since Rob already has one, and it is easier to get our own programs onto, this will be an Android tablet; we may assume Android 8 (Oreo) or later.
* Advancing or backtracking the script based on foot switches.
* Controlling lighting for a small stage. This means dimming at least two channels of 12V or 24V LED strips. Hardware should be prepared to also control some form of colour lighting.
* Lighting may or may not be preprogrammed into the script. If it is, it needs to be in a format that is easy to encode for a non-technical user, and it must be possible to override.
